Here are two example personas for two different user groups created for this design scenario:


### **Group 1**: Commuters are adults who use their bicycle primarily to communte to and from work  

* Typically aged mid 20s to 50ish years old
* Generally own one bicycle that is only used for commuting
* Commuter bicycle is usually priced mid-range, with conservative geometry and generic build.
* Bicycle might accumulate damage from continual use and being locked up &/or stored outdoors.
* Commuters might not identify as a 'cyclist' and may have only limited mechanical skills

### Example Commuter Persona:
