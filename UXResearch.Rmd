**equity-focused research** - speaking to users from underrepresented and sometimes marginalized groups to understand basically their experiences and their needs.  


## Wk1 Planning UX Research Studies

### Understand the UX Research Process
**Research Study** - A step-by-step examination of a group of users and their needs, which adds realistic content to the design process  

Steps in the UX Research process:  

1. Plan
  - outline the background for the project
  - set goals for the research. write the questions you want answered.
  - establish the steps you will take to conduct the study. who will participate?
2. Research 
  - Gather data. e.g. a usability study
  - **usability study** - a reasearch methods that assesses how easy it is for users to complete core tasks in a design. the goal of a usability study is to identify pain points & fix them early on in the design process.
3. Synthesize
  - find actual meaning in the data
  - figure out why the data is what it is
  - look for patterns in quantitative data and explore trends in qualitative data
4. Share
  - Share the results with stakeholders
  - **Project stakeholders** - people who are involved in the project or who will be impacted by its results
  - create a presentation that includes the methodology, data that was collected, conclusion from the analysis and recommendations for further action.
  
Importance of UX research: A UX research study helps us gain an understanding of user's problems in order to solve them. It also helps bridge the gap between what the business thinks a user needs and what the user actually needs.  

### Language and Communication in UX Research  

![](bestPractices.png)


* **Language and Communication Matter** - use language that is appropriate for the context (ex formal vs casual) can help you get a deeper understanding of participants' unique perspectives and values.
* **Consider Word Choices** - understand your own ideas on language use as well as the ideas other communities have. If you're not sure about what a research participant meant by something, ask them! Seek clarifications on language differences and ensure that translations of participants' insights are accurate. Avoid **ableist** language, or words that assume a person does not have a disability. Being aware of the words you use is an important step in being inclusive.  
* **Keep the Context in Mind** - consider the context that the research is happening in. ex: the physical space.

### Get to know the 7 elements of a research plan 

![](UXres_plan_elements.png)

1. Project Background - what lead you to conduct this research
2. Research Goals - what design problems are you trying to solve? how will the results of the research impact our design decisions?
3. Research Questions - what are the questions your research is trying to answer?
4. Key Performance Indicators (KPI == critical measures of progress towards the research goal)
5. Methodology - how will you collect data? how will you analyze the data?
6. Participants - who will you survey and what characteristics will they have? (should be based on research goals (sample bias: try not to be biased in subject choice))  
  - participants should be representative of all users, not just a select group
  - selected participants should reflect research goals
7. Script - discussion guide. be specific and speak to the KPIs

### Start Building a Research Plan: project background, research goals and research questions  

**Project Background** - summarizes the situation leading to the needs for this research
  - Why the project Background is important:
    - Gets the team on the same page at the beginning of the study
    - shows you understand why you're doing this research
    - promotes confidence in the overall quality of your analysis and insights
  - How to write the project background
    - Identify the signals that indicated research was necessary
    - describe any previous research
    - list insights the research will generate
    - **insights** - an observation about people that helps you understand the user or their needs from a new perspective
**Research Goals** - state the specific ideas that you would like to learn from the research or what you would like the outcomes of the research to be.  
  - **Foundational Research Goal** - Understand why or if you should build the product
  - **Design Research Goal** - Understand how to build the product
  - **Post-launch Research Goal** - Understand if the product worked as expected
**Research Questions**
