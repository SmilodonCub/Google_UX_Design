**equity-focused research** - speaking to users from underrepresented and sometimes marginalized groups to understand basically their experiences and their needs.  


## Wk1 Planning UX Research Studies

### Understand the UX Research Process
**Research Study** - A step-by-step examination of a group of users and their needs, which adds realistic content to the design process  

Steps in the UX Research process:  

1. Plan
  - outline the background for the project
  - set goals for the research. write the questions you want answered.
  - establish the steps you will take to conduct the study. who will participate?
2. Research 
  - Gather data. e.g. a usability study
  - **usability study** - a reasearch methods that assesses how easy it is for users to complete core tasks in a design. the goal of a usability study is to identify pain points & fix them early on in the design process.
3. Synthesize
  - find actual meaning in the data
  - figure out why the data is what it is
  - look for patterns in quantitative data and explore trends in qualitative data
4. Share
  - Share the results with stakeholders
  - **Project stakeholders** - people who are involved in the project or who will be impacted by its results
  - create a presentation that includes the methodology, data that was collected, conclusion from the analysis and recommendations for further action.
  
Importance of UX research: A UX research study helps us gain an understanding of user's problems in order to solve them. It also helps bridge the gap between what the business thinks a user needs and what the user actually needs.  

### Language and Communication in UX Research  

![](bestPractices.png)


* **Language and Communication Matter** - use language that is appropriate for the context (ex formal vs casual) can help you get a deeper understanding of participants' unique perspectives and values.
* **Consider Word Choices** - understand your own ideas on language use as well as the ideas other communities have. If you're not sure about what a research participant meant by something, ask them! Seek clarifications on language differences and ensure that translations of participants' insights are accurate. Avoid **ableist** language, or words that assume a person does not have a disability. Being aware of the words you use is an important step in being inclusive.  
* **Keep the Context in Mind** - consider the context that the research is happening in. ex: the physical space.

### Get to know the 7 elements of a research plan 

![](UXres_plan_elements.png)

1. Project Background - what lead you to conduct this research
2. Research Goals - what design problems are you trying to solve? how will the results of the research impact our design decisions?
3. Research Questions - what are the questions your research is trying to answer?
4. Key Performance Indicators (KPI == critical measures of progress towards the research goal)
5. Methodology - how will you collect data? how will you analyze the data?
6. Participants - who will you survey and what characteristics will they have? (should be based on research goals (sample bias: try not to be biased in subject choice))  
  - participants should be representative of all users, not just a select group
  - selected participants should reflect research goals
7. Script - discussion guide. be specific and speak to the KPIs

### Start Building a Research Plan: project background, research goals and research questions  

**Project Background** - summarizes the situation leading to the needs for this research
  - Why the project Background is important:
    - Gets the team on the same page at the beginning of the study
    - shows you understand why you're doing this research
    - promotes confidence in the overall quality of your analysis and insights
  - How to write the project background
    - Identify the signals that indicated research was necessary
    - describe any previous research
    - list insights the research will generate
    - **insights** - an observation about people that helps you understand the user or their needs from a new perspective
**Research Goals** - state the specific ideas that you would like to learn from the research or what you would like the outcomes of the research to be.  
  - **Foundational Research Goal** - Understand why or if you should build the product
  - **Design Research Goal** - Understand how to build the product
  - **Post-launch Research Goal** - Understand if the product worked as expected
**Research Questions** - questions your research will address. provides focus and structure to your research.
  - Research Questions should be:
    - Actionable - there should be a clear way to answer the questions
    - Specific - not too board
    - Avoid leading questions (should be framed in a way that does not assume a certain answer)
**Key Performance Indicators** - Critical Measures of Progress toward an end goal
  - Time on task - how long it takes for a user to complete a task. The less time it takes a user to complete a task, the more effective the UX design is.
  - Use of navigation vs search - The number of people who use a website or app's navigation compared to the number of people who use the search functionality
  - User error rates - indicate the parts of a design that cause users to make errors. help point to areas where you need to make improvements to the design of the UX
  - Drop-off rates - How many users abandon the experience
  - Conversion rates - Measures the percentage of users who complete a desired action
  - System usability scale (SUS) - a questionnaire to measure the usability of your designs
  - Net Promoter Score - a 0-10 measure of how loyal users will be to your product or service. The likelihood that a user will recommend your product to a friend or colleague
    - **Promoters** (9-10) - will recommend to others
    - **Passives** (7-8) - satisfied with the product but probably won't pass on recommendation
    - **Detractors** (0-6) - could possibly warn people away from your product
    - **NPS** == Promoters% - Detractors%
**Methodology** - the steps you take to conduct your research. 
  - Methodology informs your stakeholders of what will happen during the study, how long the study is and where it will take place
  - detailing methodology gives stakeholders more confidence in your work and conclusions
  - provides the details necessary for other to reproduce your work
**Participants** - the people you will study
  - Characteristics - should be based on research goals and be sure to avoid sample bias
  - Screener Survey - a series of questions to determine of potential participants meet the desired characteristics
  - Incentive - compensation & appreciation. something that motivates and encourages people to participate in a research study
  - Seek diverse perspectives and abilities 
    - Existing user base ... use a group of established connections
    -  Online ... social media, online design communities or online research recruitment agencies
    - Hallway testing ... ask people in person
**The Script** 
  - so you don't forget any instructions
  - so that the language is consistent for each participant
  - Use the same set of questions for each interview
  - Ask open-ended questions
  - encourage elaboration
  - ask the same questions from different angles
  - Don't mention other users
  - Don't ask leading questions
  - Script Components:
    - Getting Started
      - Welcome the participants
      - Thank the participants for their time
      - get consent to record
      - learn the participants basic information
      - remind participants they are not being tested
      - let participants ask questions
    - Usability Tasks
      - Based on Research goals
      - Specific
      - Make participants take action
      - avoid providing clues on how to complete the task
    - Conclusions
      - Ask clarifying questions
      - End the recording
      - Thank the participant

### Assistive Technology for Participants with Disabilities
**a11y** - refers to accessibility. it's shorthand for representing the 11 letters between the a and y in accessibility and resembles the word ally which reflects the idea that UX designers need to be allies to people with all types of abilities.  
**Assistive Technology** - a product, equipment or a system that enhances learning working and living for people with dissabilities

### Make Privacy a part of UX practices

1. It's the right thing to do!
2. Privacy laws and Ethics
3. The risk of Hackers
4. Protecting your company's brand

**Personally Identifiable Information** - specific details that could be used to identify a user (names, addresses, email addresses & phone numbers)  
**Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information** - Data that is lost, compromised or stolen, could cause your users financial harm embarrassment or discrimination. ( SSN, drivers license #, passport #, financial account numbers, DOB, race, disability status, gender, sexuality, criminal history, medical info)  

Privacy & Security Practices  

* Be transparent about data collection
* Only collect user data that's absolutely essential
* Get active consent
* Detail how you'll use participants' info and protect privacy
* Allow users to withdraw at any time
* Inform users of who will have access to the data
* Explain how you plan to store and secure data
