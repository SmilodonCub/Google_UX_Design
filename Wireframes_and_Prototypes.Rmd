## Storyboarding & Wireframes
Continue to Ideate and explore solutions in a low effort, low cost way.  
Come up with ideas for solutions that address the users' needs by creating wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes of the app.

### Use Research to Inform Ideation
Empathy maps, personas, user stories, and user journey maps are tools UX designers commonly use to expand our understanding of the people we are designing for. Let's review those concepts:

* Empathy Maps - an easily understood chart that explains everythong designers have learned about a type of user. explore' users' four main motivations: what the user says, thinks, does and feels. The insights gathered from empathy maps help you come up with ideas for solutions to address the user's real problems.
* Personas - fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group od users. Place the users who you are designing for front-and-center. By creating detailed user personas, you can clearly envision potential users that you'd design for.
* User Stories - fictional one-sentence story told from a perona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions.  determine which user needs are the most critical to address with your designs. This direction will help focus your ideation
* User Journey Maps - the series of experiences a user has as they interact with your product. helps you come up with ideas for designs that truly support the users' needs and solve their problems
* Problem Statement - is a clear description of the user's needs that should be addressed. The problem statement will guide the focus of your ideation.  

#### Revisiting Problem Statements
A problem statement includes a fictional user's name, characteristics, their needs, and a key insight gained from your research.

$\underline{\mbox{  (user's name) }}$ is a/an $\underline{\mbox{  (user characteristic) }}$ who needs $\underline{\mbox{  (user need) }}$ because $\underline{\mbox{  (insight) }}$  

*"What research should we be doing? Where can we have real benefit and impact to the business?"*

### Build Goal Statements
**Goal Statement** - one or two sentences that describes a product and it's benefit for the user. goal statements focus the scope for future designs...gives the ideal solution for the design  
**Goal Statements...** focus on **who** the product will srve, **what** the product will do, and **why** the product solves the user's need.  
To determine the who, what and why, refer back to the problem statement(s)  

$\underline{\mbox{  (user's name) } \Large{WHO} }$ is a/an $\underline{\mbox{  (user characteristic) }\Large{WHO}}$ who needs $\underline{\mbox{  (user need) }\Large{WHAT}}$ because $\underline{\mbox{  (insight) }\Large{WHY}}$  

Now to transition from identifying the problem to defining the goal with a goal statement  
Goals statements include:  

- description of the specific action users can take or what the product will do
- defines who the action will affect
- states the positive impact of the action or why the product solves the user's need
- outlines success in measurable terms

Our $\underline{\mbox{  (product) } \Large{WHAT} }$ will let users $\underline{\mbox{  (perform specific actions) }\Large{WHAT}}$ which will effect $\underline{\mbox{  (describe who the action will affect) }\Large{WHO}}$ by $\underline{\mbox{  (insightdescribe how the action will positively affect users) }\Large{WHY}}$  
We will measure effectiveness by $\underline{\mbox{  (describe how you will measure the impact) } \Large{HOW} }$

### Outline User Flows

Outline a User Flow  
**User Flow** - is the path taken by a typical user on an app or a website, so that they can complete a task from start to finish.  
Create user flows before designing an app, because it can help to picture how users will move through an app or website. You will need to determine:  

* What actions will users take in the app?
* What decisions will users make?
* What screens will users experience after taking action or making a decision?

![](userFlow_pic.png)

* **Action** - (circle) the actions users take when moving through a product design
* **Screen** - (rectangle) the screens of a digital product that users will experience while completing tasks
* **Decision** - (diamond) points in the user flow where users must ask a question and make a decision
* **User flow direction** - lines with arrows tie everything together

Consider the entire journey the user takes in order to get what they need from the product.   
![](userFlow_exp.png)

How do user flows compare to other processes:  

* A **user journey map** focuses on the end-to-end use case for one specific user type and one specific user case
* **Storyboards** are a visual representation of the way that a user interacts with one or multiple areas of your product
* A **user flow** describes what users see and how they interact with a product as they reach their goal. User flows illustrate all the different paths that users can take to reach their goal.

* Clear an easy flow for users to get from the entry point of opening the app, to completion of the task
* Clearly labeled steps 
* Lines and arrows connecting the steps of the user flow

### Create Storyboards

Introduction to story boarding user flows  
**Storyboard** - a series of panels or frames that visually describe and explore a user's experience with a product.  

Four elements of a storyboard  

1. Character - the user in the story
2. Scene - helps us imagine the user's environment
3. Plot - the benefit or solution of the design
4. Narrative - the user's need or problem and how the design will solve the problem

Understand the two types of storyboards  

1. **Big Picture** - (how & why) focuses on the user experience. we want to include emotion in a big picture storyboard. maybe best for early on in the design process when designers are trying to get stakeholders to support their ideas. focuses on what the user needs, their context, and why the product will be useful to the user. 
2. **Close-up** - (what) focuses on the product. what happens on each screen of a product? concentrates on the product and how it works. best used in the middle to the end of design process.

Creating a Big Picture Storyboard  

1. Start with a problem statement
2. Create a goal statement
3. Set up the storyboard
4. Add the storyboard scenario - a sentence that sets the narrative for the storyboard
5. Draw one idea per panel - set the scene, then use panels the think about actions that push the stpory forward and how the user feels in each panel
6. Expose pain points for the user along their journey 
7. Include the user goal or conclusion in the final panel

For Close-up storyboard: Big picture storyboards and close-up storyboards differ in step five, when you draw each panel. Remember, big picture storyboards focus on the user, while close-up storyboards focus on the product. For this close-up storyboard, think about which product details you want to draw attention to on each panel and why. You want to demonstrate the user flow within the product and how each action within the product will lead to the next screen.

### Get Started with Wireframes

Introduction to Wireframes   
A design solves a real problem that users are experiencing...and a strong design always puts the user front and center
**Fidelity** - How closely a design matches the look-and-feel of the final product  
**Low Fidelity** - (lo-fi) Lower amount of complexity. Less refined or polished than the intended product. useful for getting ideas out quickly while leaving room open for exploration.  
**High Fidelity** - (hi-fi) Closely matches the look and feel of the final product. More refined and polished than a lo-fi prototype.  
**Wireframe** - a basic outline of a digital experience, like an app or website. wireframes establish the basic structure of a page.  

Purposes of Wireframes  

* establish the basic structure of a page
* highlight the intended function of the product
* save time and resources

Start Drawing Wireframes  
A good wireframe is all about organizing and communicating information clearly to your colleagues who will implement your design

Industry Standards - common ways to indicate page elements  

- Text - horizontal lines
- images - boxes with and X inside
- calls to action - rectangles or circles

Benefits of Wireframes  

* Inform the elements to include in your design
* Catch problems early
* get stakeholders the focus on structure (instead of details like font/text)
* Save time and effort
* Iterate quickly

## Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Prototypes
making wireframes for a new product or feature.

### The basics of information architecture
**Information Architecture** - organizes content to help users understand where they are in a product and where the information they want is.  

Importance of Information Architecture  

* Organizes and defines the overall structure for the app or site  
* Provides a high-level view of the product  
* Help stakeholders review your designs  
* Helps engineers understand how to organize the data
* Allows your ideas to grow and iterate with the design

### Create Paper Wireframes
basic outlines (lo-fi) of a digital experience

Benefits of Paper Wireframes  

* Fast
* Inexpensive
* Explore lots of ideas

### Create Digital Wireframes
Moving from paper to digital wireframes  

* Is my paper wireframe complete?
* Have I received feedback on my paper wireframe?
* Am I ready to consider basic visual cues? 

Transitioning to digital:  

* Use actual content for important pieces of text, instead of all placeholder text. e.g. section headers and icons.  
* **Lorem ipsum** - meaningless placeholder text written in Latin that you can use to show where content will go and how a page will be laid out. To be used in wireframes where bigger chunks of text should be.
* Hold back on adding expressive content ( colors, images, etc )

Benefits of Digital Wireframes  

* Pay more attention to details
* Easier to share

![](figma_wireframes.png)

### Use Gestalt Principles when creating wireframes
Humans naturally notice the whole of something before the parts

**Gestalt Principles** - how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns and simplify complex images when we perceive objects.    

* Similarity - elements that look similar are perceived to have the same function. When designing a wireframe, consider making elements that have a similar function look similar to give your app a more intuitive user experience.
* Proximity - elements that are close together appear to be more related than things that are spaced further apart. Group like things close together when designing you app to make the grouping more intuitive
* Common Region - elements located within the same area are perceived to be together. use borders in wireframes to group elements together.

## Create Low-Fidelity Prototypes on Paper
**Prototype** - an early model of a product that demonstrates functionality. an interactive representation of your design solution

How does a digital wireframe become a low-fidelity prototype?  

* Define lo-fi prototypes: a simple, interactive model that provides a basic idea of what the product would look like
* Make designs testable so that you can collect and analyze feedback early on. 
* Demonstrating what a design idea can do in a prototype gives designers an opportunity to receive feedback and make improvements accordingly
* As designers transition from a wireframe to a low-fidelity prototype, the most significant difference is the level of interactivity, or the ability to 'click' from one screen to another.  

### Create a Paper Prototype
Benefits of paper prototypes

* Inexpensive
* Rapid Iteration
* Low Commitment
* Encourage honest feedback
* Collaborative activity

Drawbacks of paper prototypes:  

* Hard to interpret (some stretches of the imagination required)
* Need to be tested in person
* Makes remote collaboration difficult 

Building paper prototypes is most useful during brainstorming session or for early product testing  

Creative ways to make paper prototypes:  

* preprinted templates
* index cards
* sticky notes
* stencils
* demo device
* anything you can dream up!

### Introduction to Building lo-fi prototypes in Figma
Many of the tools we use can be applied to the development of both lo-fi and hi-fi designs  
Many of the skills we'll learn to build digital prototypes are transferable to other UX design applications like Adobe XD and Sketch.  

Wireframes - draw each screen a user might interact with  
Prototypes - understanding how users interact with the design (what happens when they press a button or tap a menu)


### Understand Ethical and Inclusive Design  

#### Recognize Implicit Bias in Design
We need to be aware of how our own points of view can alter our designs, influence users and affect society  
**Implicit Bias** - the collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate to people without our conscious knowledge  
Biases prevent us from understanding the complexity of a user's habits and needs.  
Without understanding our user, we can't do our best design work.  

*"It's a lot easier to treat someone like an edge case when they're not in the room"*  

#### Identify deceptive patterns in UX design
**Deceptive Patterns** - UX methods that trick users into doing or buying something they wouldn't otherwise have done or bought  
Deceptive patterns are ethically wrong and not a good business practice.  
Deceptive patterns are harder to ignore than traditional forms of advertising, because they're designed to be difficult to identity.  

* Roach motel - set up a situation that makes it very difficult for the user to exit (e.g. without paying) Turbotax comes to mind
* Forced Continuity - charging a user for a membership without a warning or a reminder
* Sneak into Basket - extra products in cart. Turbotax!!!!
* Hidden Costs - extra charges in cart. Turbotax!!!
* Confirm shaming - guilting a consumer for leaving
* Urgency - arbitrary count downs
* Scarcity - arbitrary limited number of items
* Bait and Switch - user takes an action with an expected result. However, something unplanned happens
* Ads hidden within a page that were made to look like regular content
* Misdirection - confusing a user so that they are unsure of what steps to take
* Price comparison prevention - making it difficult to compare prices with the competition

#### Understanding the Attention Economy
**Attention Economy** - The battle over users' attention. there are only 24 hours in a day, so user have to be selective about how they spend that time.  

Best practices to avoid some bad design decision:  

* **Avoid deceptive patterns** - be honest with users
* **Think about goals and metrics** - pay attention to how business goals might contradict or align with users' goals
* **Share good design practices with the people you wrok with** - use your power to influence design decisions for good.

#### Understand your impact as a UX Designer
**Ethical Design** - being conscious of how design work affects the world  
**Dominant Culture** - society often enables those with the most privilege and power  
**Marginalized Population** - people experiencing discrimination or exclusion from mainstream society because of specific characteristics or life experiences that are wrongfully deemed as inferior  
**Underrepresented** - groups of people whose values and experiences aren't represented often enough in a society that is shaped by a dominant cultures point of view.  
**Edge Cases** - Situations that a user experiences with a design/product that the designers didn't prepare for.  
**Inclusive Design** - making design choices that take into account personal identifiers like ability, race, economic status, language, age and gender.  

Ideas to put ethical design into action:  
* Create inclusive personas - avoid serving users who seem 'typical' or universal to you
* Broaden your definition of 'stakeholder' - any person or place that a project can effect
* Increase collaboration - the more insight you gain, the better your design

**Multiversal** - the many ways that a design works for different people.
