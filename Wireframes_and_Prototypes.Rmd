## Storyboarding & Wireframes
Continue to Ideate and explore solutions in a low effort, low cost way.  
Come up with ideas for solutions that address the users' needs by creating wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes of the app.

### Use Research to Inform Ideation
Empathy maps, personas, user stories, and user journey maps are tools UX designers commonly use to expand our understanding of the people we are designing for. Let's review those concepts:

* Empathy Maps - an easily understood chart that explains everythong designers have learned about a type of user. explore' users' four main motivations: what the user says, thinks, does and feels. The insights gathered from empathy maps help you come up with ideas for solutions to address the user's real problems.
* Personas - fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group od users. Place the users who you are designing for front-and-center. By creating detailed user personas, you can clearly envision potential users that you'd design for.
* User Stories - fictional one-sentence story told from a perona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions.  determine which user needs are the most critical to address with your designs. This direction will help focus your ideation
* User Journey Maps - the series of experiences a user has as they interact with your product. helps you come up with ideas for designs that truly support the users' needs and solve their problems
* Problem Statement - is a clear description of the user's needs that should be addressed. The problem statement will guide the focus of your ideation.  

#### Revisiting Problem Statements
A problem statement includes a fictional user's name, characteristics, their needs, and a key insight gained from your research.

$\underline{\mbox{  (user's name) }}$ is a/an $\underline{\mbox{  (user characteristic) }}$ who needs $\underline{\mbox{  (user need) }}$ because $\underline{\mbox{  (insight) }}$  

*"What research should we be doing? Where can we have real benefit and impact to the business?"*

### Build Goal Statements
**Goal Statement** - one or two sentences that describes a product and it's benefit for the user. goal statements focus the scope for future designs...gives the ideal solution for the design  
**Goal Statements...** focus on **who** the product will srve, **what** the product will do, and **why** the product solves the user's need.  
To determine the who, what and why, refer back to the problem statement(s)  

$\underline{\mbox{  (user's name) } \Large{WHO} }$ is a/an $\underline{\mbox{  (user characteristic) }\Large{WHO}}$ who needs $\underline{\mbox{  (user need) }\Large{WHAT}}$ because $\underline{\mbox{  (insight) }\Large{WHY}}$  

Now to transition from identifying the problem to defining the goal with a goal statement  
Goals statements include:  

- description of the specific action users can take or what the product will do
- defines who the action will affect
- states the positive impact of the action or why the product solves the user's need
- outlines success in measurable terms

Our $\underline{\mbox{  (product) } \Large{WHAT} }$ will let users $\underline{\mbox{  (perform specific actions) }\Large{WHAT}}$ which will effect $\underline{\mbox{  (describe who the action will affect) }\Large{WHO}}$ by $\underline{\mbox{  (insightdescribe how the action will positively affect users) }\Large{WHY}}$  
We will measure effectiveness by $\underline{\mbox{  (describe how you will measure the impact) } \Large{HOW} }$
