#### How did this product address special design problems that are not already fulfilled by other products?
Forest is an aesthetically pleasing motivation tool to reduce a user's dependency on their smart phone or web browzer while improving focus on other activities. As a bonus feature, virtual coins are earned which can be 'spent' on planting real trees through a partnership with Trees for the Future.   

#### What made it successful or useful?
The app periodically introduces new 'species' of trees to grow which keeps a simple app interesting and appealing. There are numerous features to visually represent a user's progress. This is an app for social good where a user's time translates to aiding reforestation efforts.  

#### What is the product's value proposition?
Help reduce digital dependencies while contributing to global conservation efforts.
